CHAPTER 3 : Laying The Foundation
---------------------------------

===> NOW, instead of using "npx parcel index.html" to run our app, we can just do
  "npm run start" OR "npm start" (That is npm run start === npm start)
   By adding a line of code in package.json file in the scripts section as "start": "parcel index.html"
   Please refer the package.json to clarify this
   SO from now on, we will just use npm start OR npm run start to run our APP
   
   NOTE 1: npx is a package running tool that comes with npm and is used to run / execute the packages from npm.
   Syntax: npx package_name file_name

   NOTE 2: It manages the packages. npm is the biggest package repository where you can find n number packages
   * npm init : Its a command used in Node.js to initialize a Node.js project / Package
   * When we do npm init, it creates a package.json file

===> Simillarly, instead of using "npx parcel build index.html" to build our app, we can just do
   "npm run build"   
   By adding a line of code in package.json file in the scripts section as "build": "parcel build index.html"
   Please refer the package.json to clarify this
   SO from now on, we will just use "npm run build" To Build our APP / Project
   (NOTE: we can not use npm build as we did for start. We have to use it as "npm run build").

===> What is JSX?
Ans: JSX stands for "JavaScript XML".
    JSX allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code, 
    making it easier to define the structure of your user interfaces.
    NOTE 1 : JSX is NOT a HTML inside JS. BUT we can say its a HTML-like / XML-like syntax.
    
    NOTE 2 : The HTML-like code written using JSX in the JS file is not a pure JS.
             This code is not understood by the JS engine. Hence Babel comes into picture.
             ** Babel is a JS Compiler which converts this JSX code into code that is understood by JS and 
             then will be rendered as HTML. 


===> Is JSX part of React ?
Ans: NOOOO. JSX (JavaScript XML) exists within JavaScript code.

===> Can we build an app without using JSX ?
Ans: YESSSSS. we can. BUT JSX makes the developers life very easy.
   That is, developing using JSX is really very easy.

===> What is a Component in React ?
Ans: In React, a component is a reusable and self-contained building block of a user interface (UI). 
     There are 2 ways to create the components in React
     1. Class Based Components : OLD style of creating components which uses JS classes to create a component
     2. Functional Components : New way of creating components which uses JS functions to create a component
        Its nothing but just a normal JS function which returns some piece of JSX.
        NOTE : A react Functional component should start with CAPITAL letters otherswise it will create an error

===> What is component composition?
Ans: Composing one or more components together is called Component Composition.
