Chapter 13 : Time For The Test

===> What are the different types of testing that a developer can do?
Ans: * Manual Testing : check everything manually
     * Writing the test cases : Write the code to check whether the code / functionality / module is working

===> A developer can write test cases for the following 3 types of testing
     * Unit Testing : Testing the components in isolation
	 
	 * Intigration Testing : Testing the integration of the components.
	 
	 * End TO End Testing (e2e testing) : Test the complete app from the begininh to end
	   Eg: from the user lands in the app till they leave the app. They need some tools to do testing

===> React Testing Library uses something know as "jest"
     * jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
	 * It works with projects using : Babel, React, Angular, Node, Vue many more
	   
===> Steps to setup the environment to write the test cases to test the app
     1. we'll be using the "React Testing Library" to write the test cases for testing
	 2. Install react testing library : "npm install -D @testing-library/react"
	 3. Install jest : "npm install -D jest"
	 4. Install Babel Dependences: npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
	 5. Configure the Babel
	 6. configure parcel's config file to disable default Babel transpilation	 
	 7. Do jest configuration : npx jest --init : this will create a jest.config.js file in out root directory	 
	 8. Install js dom library : npm install -D jest-environment-jsdom	 
	 9. Install @babel/preset-react : to make worl JSX in out test cases
	 10. Include @babel/preset-react inside the babel config
	 
	 11. Install @testing-library/jest-dom : npm install -D @testing-library/jest-dom
