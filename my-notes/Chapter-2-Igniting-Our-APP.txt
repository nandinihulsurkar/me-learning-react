1. What is npm?
==> npm does not have a full form. It does not stand for Node Package Manager.
    It manages the packages. npm is the biggest package repository where you can find n number packages

2. What is package.json ?
==> its a configuration for npm

3. Packages are also known as dependences. (True / False)
==> True.

4. The most important package is the Bundler. Then What is a Bundler ?
== >Our hole code needs to be Bundled, minifies,cached, compressed, cleaned before it is sent to the production.
   So, a bundler helps you to do all these things. It basically bundles your app, packages the app so that it can be shipped to the Production.
   Webpack, Parcel, vite are some of the examples of Bundler. All do the same thing with different algorithms to do.

5. There are 2 types of packages / dependences
   a. Dev packages / dependences  : Used for development
   b. Normal packages / dependences  : Used in Production

6. How to install a package / a dependence in our APP?
==> npm install -D package_name
    Eg: npm install -D parcel
    Where, -D tells the npm that we want a package for development, not for Production
    "^2.8.3" in the package.js tells that if a new version of parcel comes in future,
    then npm will update it to the latest MINOR version.
    BUT if you change ^ to ~
    "~2.8.3" then it will update to the latest MAJOR version.
    ITS always better to jump to the minor updated versions.

7. What is the difference between package.json AND package-lock.json?
==> package.json is a configuration for npm where it just holds the latest version of the package
    BUT
    package-lock.json holds the exact version of the package and many more details about the package.

8. What is nod_modules ?
==> It is like a database of packages. It contains the actual data of the packages.

9. What is Transitive Dependencies ?
==> Things which are internally dependent on so many other things.
    Eg: parcel is the package, which when we install a huge data nod_modules got installed.
    Where it indicates that parcel itsel is depending on so many othe packages inside there.
    Which intern may depend on other packages. And hence such a big big big nod_modules folder.

10. What happens if somehow nod_modules folder gets deleted ?
==> We can restore them just by running the command
    npm install
    It will restore all the packages again, as we have package.json & package-lock.json
    
11. Is it necessary to push the package.json & package-lock.json files to GIT ? And Why ?
==> Yes. Because these are the main files which have the information about what are the packages that are needed by app.
    Infact package.json is the confugaration for npm. 

12. Is it necessary to push the nod_modules folder to GIT ? And Why ?
==> NO. Because we can re-generate them in git using package.json & package-lock.json

13. What is npx ?
==> npx is a command-line tool used to run / execute the packages from npm.
    Syntax: npx package_name
