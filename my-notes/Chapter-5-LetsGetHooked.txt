Chapter 5 : Lets Get Hooked


===> Whenever you create a file for a component, make sure the file name and the component name is exactly same.
     This is just to make sure that anyone looking for the code would easily get it.
     Eg: Header.js means It contains the Component "Header" surely in it.

===> The component file name can be 
     - .js (as its a javascript code)
     - .jsx (as it javascript extension) OR 
     - .tsx (as type script)
     Using anything is one and the same.

===> What is a Hook?
Ans: A hook is just a normal javascript utility function which is given by react.
     * These are written by Facebook developer
     * We can find it in the react package which we have installed already

===> 2 very important Hooks are : useState() & useEffect()

===> useState() : Used to generate super powerful state variables in react
     * Why is it called state variable : Because it maintans the state of the component
     * WHENEVER a state variable updates, the React re-renders the component.
       Thats how useState() is used to keep data layer In-Sink with the UI layer

===> What is React Fiber Architecture?
Ans: React Fiber Architecture is an ongoing re-implementation of React's core algorithm.
     * Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

===> What is a virtual DOM ? AND What is Reconciliation Algorithm ?
Ans: The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where a “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM 
     by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.
	 * Reconciliation Algorithm: Its the algorithm used by react to find out the difference in virtual DOM and then updating the actual DOM
	 
===> Is the Shadow DOM the same as the Virtual DOM?
Ans: No, they are different.
     * The Shadow DOM is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in web components.
	 * The virtual DOM is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.
