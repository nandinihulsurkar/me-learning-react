Chapter 7 - Finding The Path : Routing

===> 2 types of routing in web apps. Client Side Routing & Server Side Routing


===> React is a singlepage application(SPA) because of Client Side Routing.
     * No page is reloading here.
     * Only the components are rendered however required.
	 * No network call is made until we need any api networlk call

===> We learnt about "createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, Outlet" , "Link"	, "useRouteError" provided by react-router-dom Library
	 * import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, Outlet, useParams } from "react-router-dom";
